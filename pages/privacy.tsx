					<h2>What does this Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
					<p>
						This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data that we gather
						when you access or use our Service. “Personal Data” means any
						information that identifies or relates to a particular individual
						and also includes information referred to as “personally
						identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable
						data privacy laws, rules, or regulations. This Privacy Policy does
						not cover the practices of companies we don’t own or control or
						people we don’t manage.
					</p>
					<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
					<p>
						EdgeIn.io may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws,
						regulations, and industry standards evolve, which may make those
						changes necessary, or we may make changes to our Service or
						business. We will post the changes to this page and encourage you to
						review our Privacy Policy to stay informed. If we make changes that
						materially alter your privacy rights, we will do our best to alert
						you to changes by placing a notice on the EdgeIn.io website, by
						sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that
						if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you
						haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices
						will still govern your use of the Service, and you are still
						responsible for reading and understanding them.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you use the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy have
						been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of
						information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at
						the time such information is collected.
					</p>
					<h2>What Personal Data does EdgeIn.io Collect?</h2>
					<p>We collect Personal Data about you from:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You:
							<ul>
								<li>when you provide such information directly to us, and</li>
								<li>
									when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in
									connection with your use of our Service.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Third parties, both when they provide us with Personal Data about
							you and when we seek out information for Profiles, as discussed
							below (“Third Parties”). Third Parties that share your Personal
							Data with us include:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Service providers. For example, we may use analytics service
									providers to analyze how you interact and engage with the
									Service, or third parties may help us provide you with
									customer support.
								</li>
								<li>
									Other networks connected to the Service. If you provide any
									third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to
									the Service through a third-party site or service (for
									example, using LinkedIn, Salesforce, Twitter, Facebook, or
									Google), you understand some content and/or information in
									those accounts may be transmitted into your Account with us.
								</li>
								<li>
									Advertising partners. We receive information about you from
									some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or
									promotional services related to how you interact with our
									websites, applications, products, services, advertisements, or
									communications.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						EdgeIn.io also creates profiles of people and companies, which we
						call “Profiles,” from different sources. Once we have collected
						information (primarily business-related information) about a person
						or company, we combine multiple mentions of the same person or
						company into a Profile. Profiles are then made available to users of
						the Service, and our customers and strategic partners.
					</p>
					<p>
						When we create or enhance Profiles about individuals, we may collect
						this information from multiple sources, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Publicly-available web sources that we scan using technology or
							manual methods.
						</li>
						<li>
							User contributions about themselves or other people and companies.
						</li>
						<li>Research conducted internally by EdgeIn.io.</li>
						<li>
							Other companies and data partners that license information to us.{" "}

						<em>Information Collected Automatically:</em> Like many other
						commercial websites, we may also gather information in connection

					<ul>
						<li>

							Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies
							allow us to understand how visitors use our Service such as by

							visitors are viewing pages on the Service. Performance/Analytical
							Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising
							campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the
							Service’s content for those who engage with our advertising. For
							example, Google, Inc. (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with
							its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share
							information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the
							Service is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Service and

						<em>Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:</em> We may
						serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks,
						including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors
						and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Service.
						These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain
						general profile categories or display certain preferences or
						behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Internet-Based Ads
						(including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived
						from the usage patterns of particular users on the Service and/or
						services of third-parties. Such information may be gathered through
						tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties,
						including when you leave the Service. To accomplish this, we or our
						service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a
						“web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Service. Web
						beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated
						auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web
						beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to
						you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to
						view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you
						had requested a web page from their site.
					</p>
					<p>
						Several media and marketing associations have developed an industry
						self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of,
						and greater control over, ads that are customized based on a
						consumer’s online behavior across different websites and properties.

						parties, including to opt-out of receiving behaviorally targeted
						advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the

					<h3>Sales of Personal Data</h3>
					<p>
						At {theName}, we collect information from a variety of sources
						(including information contributed directly by you and/or our user
						community) in order to compile Profiles about entities and
						individuals. Please refer to the chart above titled “Categories of
						Personal Data We Collect” for a better understanding of the Personal
						Data we collect that constitutes Profile data. {" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						In this section, we use the term ‘sell’ as it is defined in the
						CCPA. We sell your Profile data to our customers and data partners
						(such as resellers and syndication partners), subject to your right
						to opt-out of these sales (see the “Your Rights” section below for
						information about how to opt-out).
					</p>
					<p>
						We may also share your information with advertisers in order to help
						provide our ads to you. The CCPA considers this a “sale” and,
						because of this, we are required to disclose these types of
						transfers as “sales” of personal information. However, we do
						not sell this information for monetary consideration. This type of
						sharing is also subject to your right to opt out of these sales (see
						the “Your Rights” section below for information about how to
						opt-out).
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the past twelve months, we have sold the following categories
						of your Personal Data to third parties:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Personal identifiers.</li>
						<li>
							Protected classification characteristics under state or federal
							law.
						</li>
						<li>Professional or employment-related information.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Data Security and Retention</h2>
					<p>
						We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use
						and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational
						and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal
						Data and how we are processing that data, including but not limited
						to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The EdgeIn.io website uses SSL (https). </li>
						<li>Account passwords are hashed when stored in our database. </li>
						<li>
							The authenticity of request methods are verified to prevent CSRF
							(cross-site request forgery) attacks.{" "}
						</li>
						<li>
							EdgeIn.io employees use Single Sign-On (SSO) and passwords and
							enable screen locking.{" "}
						</li>
						<li>
							Access to AWS and Payment Processors is limited on a need to know
							basis and requires Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).{" "}
						</li>
						<li>
							Access to production data requires VPN access which is restricted
							to only the people that need it.{" "}
						</li>
						<li>EdgeIn.io performs third-party penetration testing.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting
						and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism;
						limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing
						off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work
						to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Data that
						we hold in our records, no security system is impenetrable, and
						unanticipated system failures or the efforts of malicious actors are
						an unfortunate reality on the Internet. Therefore, EdgeIn.io cannot
						guarantee that Personal Data during transmission through the
						Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care
						will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others. {" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open
						account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide the Service. In
						some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is
						necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or
						collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by
						applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some
						information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way
						that would identify you personally.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Personal Data of Children</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						As noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or
						solicit Personal Data from children under 16. If you are a child
						under 16, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the
						Service or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected
						Personal Data from a child under 16, we will delete that information
						as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may
						have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at
						privacy@EdgeIn.io.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>California Resident Rights</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in

						section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these
						rights. If there are any conflicts between this section and any
						other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California

						about this section or whether any of the following applies to you,

					<p>
						<strong>Exercising Your Rights</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request

						Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an
						account to submit a Valid Request.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of
						receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request
						unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
						unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee,
						we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before
						completing your request.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following method: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Emailing us at: privacy@edgein.io</li>

						<li>privacy@edgein.io </li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to
						reauthorize the sale of your Personal Data for at least 12 months.
						However, you may change your mind and opt back in to Personal Data
						sales at any time by creating a new public profile for yourself.{" "}
					</p>

						However, we may have different tiers of services as allowed by
						applicable data protection laws (including the CCPA) with varying
						prices, rates, or levels of quality of the goods or services you
