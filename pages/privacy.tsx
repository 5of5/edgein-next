        <h2 className="">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          EdgeIn.io Inc. (EdgeIn, “we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to
          protecting the privacy of personal information (i.e., any information
          relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) who visit
          the EdgeIn.io website (the “Site”). Amendments to this Privacy Policy
          will be posted to the Site and will be effective when posted. Your
          continued use of the Site following the posting of any amendment to
          this Privacy Policy shall constitute your acceptance of such
          amendment.
        </p>

        <h2 className="">Your consent</h2>
        <p>
          You might fill out a contact form on the Site and provide your name,
          email address, as well as any additional information you may provide
          us in the message box. By providing personal information to us, you
          voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such
          personal information as specified in this Privacy Policy. Without such
          information, we could not provide you with our services. The legal
          basis for our processing of personal information are primarily that
          the processing is necessary for providing our services or answer to
          your request (i.e. for the performance of a contract between you and
          us), and that the processing is carried out in our legitimate
          interests, which are further explained below. Without limiting the
          foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use,
          or disclose your personal information in specific circumstances.
        </p>

        <h2 className="">Information we collect about you</h2>
        <p>We collect several types of information:</p>
        <p>
          Personal Data. We collect information by which you may be personally
          identified, such as your name, email address, postal address or phone
          number, through the contact form on our Site (“personal data”). This
          information is only collected when you voluntarily provide it and it
          is necessary to contact you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usage Data. We also collect information about your use of the Site.

          (“usage data”). We collect this information using cookies, web beacons
          and Google Analytics. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard
          drive of your computer. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting
          so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you
          direct your browser to the Site. A web beacon is a small electronic
          file (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel
          gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited a
          page and for other related Site statistics (e.g., recording the
          popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server
          integrity).

          manipulated or combined to provide generalized, anonymous information.
          Your identity and personal information will be kept anonymous in
          Aggregated Data.
        </p>

        <h2 className="">Storage of personal information</h2>
        <p>
          Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country
          where we have facilities or in which we engage third party service
          providers, notably in Canada and United States. By using the Site, you
          consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your
          country of residence, which may have different data protection rules
          than in your country. While such information is outside of Canada, it
          is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be
          subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or
          regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of
          such country. However, our practices regarding your personal
          information will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy
          Policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the General Data
          Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) requirements providing adequate
          protection for the transfer of personal information from the EU/EEA to
          third country, notably by entering into standard contractual clauses.

          We may occasionally communicate with you regarding our products,
          services, news, jobs, and events. You have the option to not receive
          this information. We provide an opt-out function within all email
          communications of this nature, or will cease to communicate with you
          for this purpose if you contact us and tell us not to communicate this
          information to you.
        </p>
