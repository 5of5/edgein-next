          The portfolio companies identified and discussed on this Site may not

          companies were selected as representative examples that clarify and
          typify EdgeIn.io’s investment strategy and not as an exhaustive list
          of EdgeIn.io’ investments. These companies are updated from time to

          confidentiality restrictions, a full list of portfolio companies for a
          particular fund is available to prospective investors on request. Not
          every portfolio investment made by a EdgeIn.io investment fund will
          participate in the EdgeIn.io Seed Program or Series A Program. Any
          case study provided is shown for illustrative purposes as an example
          of potential ecosystem development or education services that could be
          provided by EdgeIn.io Incubator, L.L.C., and should not be considered
          as any advertisement or solicitation of interest to invest into any

          securities advised by EdgeIn.io or any of its affiliates or
          representatives. Further, no content or information on this Site or

          circumstances should anything herein be construed as fund marketing
          materials by prospective investors considering an investment into any
          EdgeIn.io investment fund. Content contained in the Services including
          podcasts, videos, blog posts and social media is not directed to any
          investors or potential investors, and does not constitute an offer to
          sell — or a solicitation of an offer to buy — any securities, and may
          not be used or relied upon in evaluating the merits of any investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          An offer to invest in a EdgeIn.io-managed pooled investment vehicle
          will be made separately and only by means of the confidential offering
          documents of the specific pooled investment vehicles — which should be
          read in their entirety, and only to those who, among other
          requirements, meet certain qualifications under federal securities
          laws. Such investors, defined as accredited investors, are generally
          deemed capable of evaluating the merits and risks of prospective
          investments and financial matters. There can be no assurances that
          EdgeIn.io’ investment objectives will be achieved or investment
          strategies will be successful. Any investment in a vehicle managed by
          EdgeIn.io involves a high degree of risk including the risk that the
          entire amount invested is lost. Any investments or portfolio companies
          mentioned, referred to, or described are not representative of all
          investments in vehicles managed by EdgeIn.io and there can be no
          assurance that the investments will be profitable or that other
          investments made in the future will have similar characteristics or
          results. Prospective investors should bear in mind that past results
          are not necessarily indicative of future results and there can be no
          assurance any portfolio company of any investment fund advised by
          EdgeIn.io will achieve results comparable to those of any company
          listed on this Site or within content provided pursuant to the
          Services, or that any investment fund advised by EdgeIn.io will
          achieve results comparable to any prior or existing fund advised by
          EdgeIn.io or its principals.
