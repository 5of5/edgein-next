## Getting Started

### Install Node 16

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Install docker-desktop 

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/ 

If you already have docker installed make sure the following command runs: 
```
docker compose version
```
any issues and you probably have an outdated docker install (command used to be docker-compoose)

### Start Docker containers 
```
npm run docker:start
```
this should build a local database and hasura engine. Check they are up with:
```
docker ps
```
your output should look something like:
```
968caa7ae2fe   postgres:14.1                  "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   23 hours ago   Up 23 hours (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   infra-postgres-1
de3c3c77c736   hasura/graphql-engine:v2.7.0   "graphql-engine serve"   23 hours ago   Up 23 hours             0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   infra-graphql-engine-1
```

### Start Next App 
```
npm run dev
``` 

## Editing Graphql

- Make changes .graphql file (NOT TO EDIT types.ts)
- Make sure a local instance of hasura is running
- Run `npm run codegen` this will generate a

## Migrations

- Run `npm run hasura migrate apply`
- Run `npm run hasura metadata apply`

## Creating Migrations

- Run `npm run hasura console`
- Use the hasura console to create the migration files

### Remove Hasura migrations

This will update the `schema.sql` file to have all current migrations
applied, and deletes them so that we don't reapply them.

1. Create a "clean" Hasura instance locally:
1. Dump the schemas and select Hasura metadata:
   ```
   pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U edgeu \
       --exclude-table-data "hdb_catalog.*log*" \
       --exclude-table-data hdb_catalog.hdb_schema_update_event \
       --schema public --schema hdb_catalog --schema hdb_views -v -f ./infra/hasura/dev-bootstrap/schema.sql edgedb
   ```
1. Comment out `CREATE SCHEMA public` so that it won't error when it's loaded by docker.
1. Delete old migrations:
   ```
   rm -rf hasura/migrations/*
   ```
